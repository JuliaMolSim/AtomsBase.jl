For example, to get the position of a single particle in an AoS implementation, the explicit function chaining would be position(getindex(sys)) (i.e. extract the single struct representing the particle of interest and query its position), while for SoA, one should prefer an implementation like getindex(position(sys)) (extract the array of positions, then index into it for a single particle).

The more flexible implementation is based on an array-of-structs approach and can be easily customised, e.g. by adding custom properties or by swapping the underlying Atom struct by a custom one. In both cases the respective datastructures can be used either fully or in parts in downstream packages and we hope these to develop into universally useful types within the Julia ecosystem over time.","category":"page"},{"location":"overview/#Struct-of-Arrays-/-FastSystem","page":"Overview","title":"Struct of Arrays / FastSystem","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"overview/","page":"Overview","title":"Overview","text":"The file src/fast_system.jl contains an implementation of AtomsBase based on the struct-of-arrays approach.
